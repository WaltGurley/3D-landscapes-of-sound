# 3D Landscapes of Sound

> Use A-Frame components to analyze audio and generate real-time audio-reactive 3D objects.

These materials were developed for a workshop as part of the [NCSU Libraries Data and Visualization workshop series](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/workshops/category/data-and-visualization).

The A-Frame components created for this workshop are based on code developed by [Payod Panda](https://github.com/PayodPanda)


### About this workshop

This project incorporates the [aframe-audioanalyser-component](https://github.com/ngokevin/kframe/tree/master/components/audioanalyser/) to access Web Audio data in A-Frame.
